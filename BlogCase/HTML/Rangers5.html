								Rangers vs. Canadiens Game 4: On playing with leads, and closing out

						</header><p class="data">Gepost door Michiel</p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Student/Documents/Visual%20Studio%202012/Projects/BlogCase/BlogCase/HTML/images/sample5.jpg" /><p><p><span style="">The Rangers held three different leads Sunday night, while their lastâ€”even though it was the shortest livedâ€”was the most important. Martin St. Louis' goal 6:04 into the first overtime session gave New York a 3-2 victory, and a 3-1 lead in their Eastern Conference Finals series again Montreal.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">The Rangers are now 10-3 in the postseason in games in which they've scored first, while they improved to 9-0 when leading after two periods. For the second time all postseason, the Blueshirts hold a two-game edge in a series.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">Montreal was able to climb back into Sunday night's game twice. First, a bad decision by Anton Stralman in the neutral zone sprung David Desharnais and Francis Bouillon on a 2-on-1 to knot the score at one. Then, the Rangers seventh penalty of the contest finally cost them, as a P.K. Subban blast got through Henrik Lundqvist to send the game into overtime.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">But in the end, St. Louis was able to sneak one over the glove of Dustin Tokarski and under the crossbar for the Game 4 victory. The Canadiens' comeback ultimately fell short, and, the Rangers protected a lead, not only on the scoreboard, but in the series.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">Momentum is a tricky thing when it comes to playoff hockey. Day-to-day, it doesn't really exist. The 7-2 thrashing the Rangers handed out in Game 1 was followed by a game in which they were outplayed. (Yes, they won that game, and again, it just goes back to how there's no rhyme of reason to hockey.)</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">Which is precisely why, when the series shifted back to New York, with the Rangers up 2-0, Montreal rallied in Game 3 to turn it into a series. It was one of the three Rangers' losses all playoffs when New York struck first. The lead was not protected, while the Blueshirts still clung to an edge in the series.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">But if you're talking about momentum, or at least feeling the affects of a win in a seven-game series, look no further than Sunday night. Had the Rangers lost, they would have again, for the second straight game (both on their home ice), allowed Montreal to erase a deficit on the scoreboard to ultimately erase a deficit in the series.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">Demoralizing? Maybe not. But doubt-inducing? Potentially, sure.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">On the flip-side, it wasn't as much a demoralizing loss for Montreal as a reality check. Win three straightâ€”two of which on home ice, where they've yet to beat the Rangers this series, and one in Madison Square Gardenâ€”or face elimination.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">The Canadiens were an overtime goal Sunday night from completely changing the dynamic of this series. Or if Alex Galchenyuk's wrister in the third had missed Lundqvist's stick, or rotated a bit differently as it hit the crossbar, and again, maybe it's a 2-2 tie heading back to the Bell Centre.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">Hockey is a game of bounces, and you need good ones to have any chance at winning a Cup. Meanwhile, the Rangers did what they needed to do when heading home with a 2-0 series lead: they protected it. Now, they have to win one of the next three to give themselves a chance at hockey's grandest prize.</span></p></p>

					<h4>
						About
					</h4><p>The New York Rangers are a professional ice hockey team based in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). Playing their home games at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers are one of the oldest teams in the NHL, having joined in 1926 as an expansion franchise. They are part of the group of teams referred to as the Original Six, along with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rangers were the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the Stanley Cup,[1] which they have done four times, most recently in 1993–94.</p>
