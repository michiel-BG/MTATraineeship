After acquiring Martin St. Louis at the trade deadline, the expectationâ€”per trading a second round pick that could of (and became) a first if New York reach the Eastern Conference Finalsâ€”was that the Blueshirts would be one of the last four teams standing.

					<h4>
						About
					</h4><p>The New York Rangers are a professional ice hockey team based in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). Playing their home games at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers are one of the oldest teams in the NHL, having joined in 1926 as an expansion franchise. They are part of the group of teams referred to as the Original Six, along with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rangers were the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the Stanley Cup,[1] which they have done four times, most recently in 1993–94.</p>
