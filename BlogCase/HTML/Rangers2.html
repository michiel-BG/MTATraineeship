						</header><p class="data">Gepost door Michiel</p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Student/Documents/Visual%20Studio%202012/Projects/BlogCase/BlogCase/HTML/images/sample2.jpg" /><p><p><span style="">According to the New York Rangers official Twitter feed, Derek Stepan is on the ice this morning as the team prepares for Game 5 tonight against the Montreal Canadiens. Shortly after, the team broke off into line rushes and Stepan was taking those rushes with Rick Nash, and Chris Kreider. While nothing is official based off of the morning skate, the fact that Stepan is taking line rushes is a very good indication that he plays tonight.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">Taking all of the above into account, many believe that Stepan will play tonight, which would be a massive boost for the Rangers. Getting Derick Brassard back last game already paid huge dividends as he scored a massive goal in the second period of Game 4, and picked up right where he left off. Potentially having Stepan back to complete the top line tonight would mark the first time this entire series that the Rangers have had a completely healthy lineup.</span></p><p><span style=""></p><p><span style="">I guess Stepan wasn't faking it after all, right Briere and Gallagher?</span></p></p>

						About
					</h4><p>The New York Rangers are a professional ice hockey team based in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). Playing their home games at Madison Square Garden, the Rangers are one of the oldest teams in the NHL, having joined in 1926 as an expansion franchise. They are part of the group of teams referred to as the Original Six, along with the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rangers were the first NHL franchise in the United States to win the Stanley Cup,[1] which they have done four times, most recently in 1993â€“94.</p>
