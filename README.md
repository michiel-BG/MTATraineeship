MTATraineeship
==============
As a final project in this Traineeship we were tasked with buiding a solution to create a blogpost in the .Net Framework. I build a WPF application that creates blogposts with rich text formatting and image and video content capable of displaying the content of the blogpost in different CSS-templates.
